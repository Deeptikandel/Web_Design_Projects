    <h2>WELCOME TO MILLBANK RESCUE CENTER </h2>
    <p>
    We are here to provide the shelter for lost and abandoned dogs in the local area. A safe home is provided for dogs until their owner's come and take them. If their owners do not show up, we also provide you the rehoming service. Public can visit the rescue center and rehome the abandoned dogs. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Millbank Rescue center has been running over years being one of the successful destinations for abandoned dogs. We have experienced an increase in number of dogs recent years. We are in search of good homes for the dogs to make sure that your dog has adequate care and attention, throughout its life. So rehoming process is done taking care of the home environment of buyers as well. . 
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe that dogs need exercise, they are pack animals and need lots of love and attention. We pay full attention towards our dog's health. Our active volunteers have been contributing in maintaining the dog's health. Work experience at Dogs rescue center is offered on a very limited basis due to the time and resources needed to ensure the experience is productive and safe for every candidate. We are providing you the work experience service through volunteering.
