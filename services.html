    <h2>Millbank Services</h2>
        <p>
        Millbank rescue center pays attention towards dog's health and fitness as well. Remember, dogs need exercise, they are pack animals and need lots of love and attention - you need to make sure that you have the kind of lifestyle that enables you to provide the care and attention that your new addition will need, but most importantly you need to ensure that your family will have the time available to make sure that your dog has adequate care and attention, throughout its life.

        <h3>Responsible owners and responsible buyers</h3>
        <p>
        Kennel Club research has shown a shocking number of people still buying puppies from disreputable sources: one in three revealed their puppies were sourced on internet sites, through social media, in pet shops and newspapers advertisements - all sources popularly used by puppy farmers. The Kennel Club's Do's and Don'ts of Buying a Puppy video looks at the perils of the puppy farming trade, and informs them of the benefits of buying a puppy from a Kennel Club Assured Breeder, who agrees to care for their dogs' health and welfare.
